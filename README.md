*Brief Overview:*  
  "The app is built using Android Studio and Kotlin. It uses simple UI elements like EditText, TextView, and Button to interact with the user, and it implements a straightforward control flow to decide which meal to suggest."

### 2. *User Interface (UI) Explanation*

- *Discuss the Layout:*  
  "In the layout file (activity_main.xml), I've defined an EditText for user input, a TextView for displaying the meal suggestion, and a Button to reset the fields. The UI is designed to be clean and user-friendly."

- *Highlight Design Choices:*  
  "I used a RelativeLayout to position the elements with appropriate margins and paddings, ensuring the interface is visually appealing and easy to navigate."

### 3. *Code Walkthrough*

- *Main Activity Overview:*  
  "The main logic of the app is in MainActivity.kt. Here’s how the code works:"

- *Input Handling:*  
  "When the user enters a time of day in the EditText, the app captures the input and logs it using Log.d for debugging purposes."

- *Meal Suggestion Logic:*  
  "I use a when statement to match the input with a specific time of day. Based on the input—such as 'morning', 'mid-morning', 'afternoon', etc.—the app displays a corresponding meal suggestion."

- *Error Handling:*  
  "If the input doesn't match any expected values, the app shows a Toast message informing the user that the input is invalid, and it prompts them to enter a valid time. This helps prevent errors and guides the user."

- *Reset Functionality:*  
  "The reset button clears both the input field and the suggestion TextView. This ensures the user can quickly start over if needed."

- *Logging and Debugging:*  
  "I’ve added logging statements throughout the code to help trace the user’s input and the internal flow of the app. This is especially useful for debugging during development."
